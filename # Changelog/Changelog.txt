# TODO
#------------------------------
Add new weapons
Add new armor
Do the weapon/armor icons

Look at Ashes Focus Blast anim on Caestus
Fix Binded set masks

Adjust class stats, reduce the inflated ones.
Add option to allow Irina dark ending
Tier the primordial titanite into the 3 tiers + essence. That way bosses can drop different forms, controlling progression of weapon a bit better.
