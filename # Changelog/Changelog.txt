# Changelog
#------------------------------
# Summons
- Made most of the white phantom summon signs unconditional to make them more useful.

# Companions
- Weakened Solaire's damage in NG a bit.
- Adjusted Solaire so his AI is less annoying. He will enter battles more readily and no longer spams Oath of Sunlight.
- Solaire will now draw enemy aggro naturally, making him more useful in frantic fights.
- Solaire gains an estus flask every 15 seconds, allowing him to heal throughout the course of a level.

# Spells
- Crystal Soul Spear: FP to 600.
- Great Soul Dregs: FP to 800.
- Climax: FP to 400.
- Iron Flesh: now boosts Physical ABS by 75%, but reduces all elemental ABS by 100%. Lasts 15 seconds, 30 whilst ascended.

# Infusions
- Fire/Dark now get 15% free scaling instead of 30%.

# Items
- Increased the drop rate of gems from enemies.
- Changed the material drops to have a chance to drop multiple, to add more benefit to high Item Discovery.
- The Drowsy Villager in Ariandel now gives you the Ceaseless Dung Pie.

# Enemies
- Extended the lock-on distance against all enemies.
- Made the Red Crystal Lizards more of a threat. They are now immune to damage and cause you to stagger if hit, and their explosion(s) fire earlier.
- Added a killable Red Crystal Lizard in the lower part of Irithyll Dungeon. Killing it will enable several spawns of Red Crystal Lizards in the Profaned Capital.
- The COA Bonewheel Skeletons added in the catacombs now shoot black fireballs whilst spinning.
- Removed the Undead Hexers.
- Removed the Roaming Sorcerers.
- Removed the Demon Prince enemies in Smouldering Lake due to issues. The Stray Demon near the back of the lake now drops the Undead Bone Shard.
- Moved the Prowler into the Firelink Shrine part of Dreg Heap.
- Reduced the aggro range of Morne's Armor.

# Map
- Changed the Pilgrim Dummy into a skeleton.

- Moved Irina back to her original placement.
- Moved the Altar of Affliction to the alcove near to the Dummy.
- Morne's Armor no longer unlocks the Cleansing Chapel bonfire (those changes have been reverted). It is now found in front of the grand doors on the way up to the Cathedral from the graveyard section. It drops Morne's Ring.

# Bugfixes
- Added back fogwall to Oceiros arena to prevent the player from leaving during refights.
- Fixed the Curse of Folly description not appearing.
