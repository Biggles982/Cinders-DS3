# Changelog
#------------------------------

# Armor
- Changed the interval for the aux inflict auras to 5 seconds to reduce the weird AI behavior.
- Increased the Poison/Frost inflicted by the armor auras to account for this. Curse has been left as is since it is the strongest one.

# Shops
- The memory shop is now reset properly when you enter NG+.
- You can now purchase a boss's memories whilst a boss has been respawned.
- Yoel now sells the Dark Hand.

# Enemies
- The Undead Settlement Black Knights are now hostile to other enemies.

# Bugfixes
- Removed the weapon VFX from Steady Chant/Chant from the Depths WA to prevent confusion (the icon below FP shows you when it is active still).
- Livid Pyromancer Dunnel now spawns properly (His CharInit was accidently deleted before).
- Greatsword and Greatshield of Artorias now actually transposed from the Triad soul.
