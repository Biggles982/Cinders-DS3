# Changelog
#------------------------------
# General
- Enabled the Undead Match by default, Champion's Ashes are no longer needed.
- Enabled Transposition without the need for the Transposing Kiln.

# Companions
- Removed all but Solaire. This is due to the instability adding so many was causing.

# Infusions
- Enchanted restores 3 FP per second.
