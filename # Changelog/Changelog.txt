# Changelog
#------------------------------
# General
- Ludleth's Crown is now a reward from killing the Soul of Cinder without being hit. (Deathless is no longer rewarded in anyway).
- The Advance Journey dialogue now takes place in a menu, and gives you 3 chances to exit before it puts you into NG+.

# Companions
- Added a Companion system. Allows you to assign yourself a companion, that you can summon to you anywhere in the game world. They act like summons, except they last forever and do not have any of the restrictions summons normally have regarding bosses.

- To begin using a companion, you must assign one at the Altar of Kinship. This is found behind Lothric's throne in Firelink Shrine.

- Having assigned a companion, you can then summon them using the Beckoning Incense. This is a re-usable tool that warps them to your current location. It is found in front of Ludleth in Firelink Shrine.

- Companions are made available when you have acquired certain items.
 - Knight Solaire: have the Warrior of Sunlight covenant item.
 
- Notes:
 - The strength of companions varies based on the map you are in.
 - You will need to use the Beckoning Incense to get your companion past fogwalls or places where the navmesh doesn't support transition. 
 - If your companion dies, you'll need to reload the map to summon them again.
 
# Status Effects
- Frost:
 - Cannot be re-applied for 8 seconds.
 - Deals 50 + 5% damage on proc.
 - Reduces stamina by -200 on proc.
 
# NPCs
- Karla is now brought to the shrine after you turn in the Accursed Signet to the Fire Keeper. It is found in High Wall.

# Enemies
- Moved a mimic into Karla's old room in Irithyll Dungeon.

# Bugfixes
- Cornyx now removes the Profaned Pyromancy Tome when taking it.
- Karla no longer appears in Irithyll Dungeon.
- Wave damage in the Trial no longer requires the player to be the source to count.
- Dreams/Nightmares/Beckoning Incense cannot be used as a client player.
