# Changelog
#------------------------------
# Companions
- Weakened Solaire's power and HP.

# Spells
- Crystal Soul Spear: FP to 600.
- Great Soul Dregs: FP to 800.
- Climax: FP to 400.
- Iron Flesh: now boosts Physical ABS by 75%, but reduces all elemental ABS by 100%. Lasts 15 seconds, 30 whilst ascended.

# Items
- Increased the drop rate of gems from enemies.
- Changed the material drops to have a chance to drop multiple, to add more benefit to high Item Discovery.

# Enemies
- Extended the lock-on distance against all enemies.
- Made the Red Crystal Lizards more of a threat. They are now immune to damage and cause you to stagger if hit, and their explosion(s) fire earlier.
- Added a killable Red Crystal Lizard in the lower part of Irithyll Dungeon. Killing it will enable several spawns of Red Crystal Lizards in the Profaned Capital.
- The COA Bonewheel Skeletons added in the catacombs now shoot black fireballs whilst spinning.
